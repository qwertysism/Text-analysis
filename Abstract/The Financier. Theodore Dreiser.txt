An unsurpassed master of literary naturalism, Theodore Dreiser is known for the great intensity of his prose and his accurate, reporter-like view of events.
The Financier is a very powerful novel that explores the development of America's financial system during the Civil War and after with the stock market panic and other turmoil. The first novel in the Desire Trilogy, The Financier tells the story of aggressive and ruthless stockbroker Frank Cooperwood, who has made a fortune at the age of 21 and continues to climb the ladder of success no matter what, and does not disdain unscrupulous means. Cooperwood's entire life seems to confirm the thesis that a crime is hidden behind every large fortune.
