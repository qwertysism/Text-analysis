The Lovely Bones, written by American author Alice Sebold and published in 2002, tells the tragic story of Susie Salmon. Susie is 14-year-old girl from suburban Norristown, Pennsylvania, whom her neighbor, George Harvey, rapes and murders. After her death, Susie narrates the novel in the first person from heaven as she uses her omniscience to observe her friends and family. The novel focuses on how those who knew Susie react to her death and attempt to move forward with their lives. While Susie’s family members struggle with her absence in their own ways, they eventually come to terms with the tragedy. Meanwhile, Susie’s sister and classmates experience their comings-of-age and negotiate their entrances into adulthood.
