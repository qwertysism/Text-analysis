Published anonymously in 1813 by English author Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is an example of a “novel of manners,” which presents a realistic picture of society through the customs and manners of everyday life. By depicting complex relationships between landowners and tradesmen, those with old money and the nouveaux riche, and men and women, Pride and Prejudice offers a glimpse into the social structures of early 19th-century England. The novel’s primary focus is marriage, specifically in its capacity as the most practical way for women of small fortune to ensure their financial security. It touches on how property laws make women dependent on male relations and on the narrow standards for women’s behavior. It also comments on the complicated social hierarchy revolving around land ownership and etiquette. Many characters in Pride and Prejudice seek to make themselves appear socially superior and to ingratiate themselves to the wealthy; the novel, however, argues that true good breeding entails integrity, kindness, and humility
