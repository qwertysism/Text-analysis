The novel "The Burden of Human Passions" is perhaps the most famous and, of course, the most artistically successful in the creative heritage of Somerset Maugham.

The novel reveals the coming-of-age story of an orphan with a lameness, Philip Carey. Raised by an uncle, vicar, and aunt, he grew up according to the rules of their house and church. He endures bullying at school, but does well academically, hoping to get into Oxford.

Deciding, nevertheless, to abandon the spiritual career, Philip goes to Heidelberg, where he finally renounces religion and tries to develop a philosophy for his own life. Meeting in London with the waitress Mildred will play a fatal role in his fate. An irresistible passion for a woman who is far below Philip in intellectual and social terms will be a real shock to his whole life.
