Published in 1851, Moby Dick was based in part on author Herman Melville’s own experiences on a whaleship. The novel tells the story of Ahab, the captain of a whaling vessel called The Pequod, who has a three-year mission to collect and sell the valuable oil of whales at the behest of the ship’s owners. Instead, the furious Ahab takes the ship on his own personal journey through hell, seeking revenge against the eponymous white whale who took his leg leading to alienation, rebellion, doubt, and doom for all aboard. The novel is narrated by Ishmael, a dreamy and disaffected man who tells the tale with his own unique opinions and digressions, ranging on subjects of literature, philosophy, science, and sailing. It is a classic work of literature, told with both humor and fury. Some consider it the greatest novel ever written. This summary refers to the 2003 edition published by Penguin.
