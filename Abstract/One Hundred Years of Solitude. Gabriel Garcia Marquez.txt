Nobel Prize-winning Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez’s novel One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), considered his magnum opus, spans seven generations and chronicles the Buendía family beginning with the life of its patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía. José is remembered for having founded the fictional town Macondo in Colombia. The novel, tied intimately to the real history of Colombia, also incorporates magical realism, positioning itself as an important text of the literary period known as the Latin American Boom in the 1960s and 1970s. This period came into being as a hybrid of Western modernism and the Cuban avant-garde movement
