The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a novel written by Mark Twain and published in 1876. The novel is largely based in Twain’s own memories of his childhood hometown, Hannibal, a river town in Missouri. The novel isn’t quite as successful as its sequel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which skyrocketed Twain to the role of noteworthy American author. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer includes themes of youth, race, religion, visions of America, the supernatural, language and communication, morality and maturity, and the hopes, plans, and dreams of the young boys who are its protagonists.
