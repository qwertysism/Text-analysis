Lullaby is a novel by critically acclaimed writer Chuck Palahniuk. In this novel, Carl Streator, a journalist, is doing a story on crib death when he notices a strange connection between not only the deaths of these babies, but of his own wife and infant as well. As Streator continues to investigate a culling song he believes is responsible for all these deaths, he meets Helen Hoover Boyle, a real estate agent, who has also suffered and profited from this same culling song. Lullaby is a novel that questions the conformity of society and the media that appears to have the power to control the world's thoughts and desires.
