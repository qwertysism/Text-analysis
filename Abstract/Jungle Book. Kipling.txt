The Jungle Book was published in 1893, and is actually a collection of seven short stories. The settings and characterizations are drawn from Kipling’s own experiences during his nineteenth-century travels around the British Empire, and include locations like India, Afghanistan and the Bering Sea. The stories all feature talking animals, and though geared toward children, are set with themes that easily reach mature audiences as well, including prejudice, hypocrisy and greed. These traits marked Kipling’s travels in the British colonies but are just as relevant today.
