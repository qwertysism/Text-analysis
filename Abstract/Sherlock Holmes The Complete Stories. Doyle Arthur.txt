Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve short stories. Each tale features the criminal investigations of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, as seen through the first-person perspective of his partner, Dr. John H. Watson. The individual stories were serialized in The Strand Magazine between 1891 and 1892, increasing Doyle’s popularity. Most of the tales attempt to identify and rectify social injustices among European aristocrats in the twentieth century.
