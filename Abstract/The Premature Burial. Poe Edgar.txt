“The Premature Burial” (1844), a horror story written by the master of horror, Edgar Allan Poe, tells the story of a man who is so obsessed with being buried alive that he constructs an elaborate plan to prevent it from happening. Being buried alive was a common fear at that time, and this story played right into public interest.
