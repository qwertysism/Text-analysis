Eat Pray Love, subtitled “One Woman’s Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,” is a 2006 memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert. Gilbert is a writer by trade; she worked at GQ for five years and had already published two novels (Stern Men and The Last American Man) when Eat Pray Love was written. The occasion for the memoir is Gilbert’s search for self in the wake of her divorce. After a very difficult legal settlement, a toxic affair and bought of severe depression, Gilbert decides to take a year to travel because she finally feels justified in doing something that she wants to do. She muses that she has chosen to visit three places that begin with “I”, which is a metaphor for what she hopes to find by the end of her journey: a sense of self, or independence. Gilbert states in the Introduction that she has modelled the structure of her book on Indian prayer beads called japa malas. There are 108 beads strung together, which holds a special significance in that it is a three-digit multiple of three. As such, Eat Pray Love is divided into three main sections, each composed of 36 smaller parts (the number 36 is also significant because Gilbert is 36 at the time she writes the Introduction), or “beads” as Gilbert refers to them.
