Ivanhoe (1819), a work of historical fiction by Walter Scott, provides a fanciful account of English life in the medieval twelfth century. Weaving together historical models of the tournament, witch trials, outlaws, and Jewish-Christian conflict, Scottâ€™s book attempts to revive interest in medievalism and romance in modern literary culture. It succeeded in doing so, contributing to popular character archetypes, such as King John and Robin Hood. The book primarily concerns the protagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe who goes on a journey full of romance, tournaments, and familial reconciliation.
